	 <p class="main">
		<b>In short:</b> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law,
		 like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our
		  legitimate business interests.<br>
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <b>If you are located in the <span class="country">EU or UK,</span> this section applies to you.</b><br>
		  <br>
		  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information.
		   As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
	 </p>
	 
	 <ul>
		<li class="nu3"><b>Consent.</b>  We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information

			 We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your
			  interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.
			 For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</li>
		    <li class="mini">Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</li>

			<li class="mini">Support our marketing activities</li>
		    <li class="mini">Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>

			 enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
		<li class="nu3"><b>Vital Interests.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
</li>
	</ul>
<br>
	 <b>If you are located in <span class="country">Canada,</span> this section applies to you.</b><br>
	 <br>

		<br>
In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
</p>

<ul>
	<li class="nu3">If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
	<li class="nu3">For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
	<li class="nu3">For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
	<li class="nu3">If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>

	<li class="nu3">If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
	<li class="nu3">If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy
		 of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
	<li class="nu3">If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>

	<br>
	We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services.
	 Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.<br>
	 <br>
	 We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements,

		<br>
		To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a "sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws)

<p class="main">
		<b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes 
outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.<br>
<br>
We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the 
purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or 
permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in 
this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days.<br>
<br>
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal 
information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not 
possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup 
archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any 
further processing until deletion is possible.
	 </p>

<h2 class="maine" id="7">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? </h2>

<p class="main">
		<b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system 
of organizational and technical security measures.<br>
<br>
<br>
We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical 
and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal 
information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your 
information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage 
technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee 
that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to 
defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. 
Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of 
personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only 
access the Services within a secure environment. 
	 </p>

We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of 
age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, nor do we knowingly 
sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at 
least 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are the 
parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the 
Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age or 
the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction has been collected, we will 
deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data 
from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from 
children under age 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, 
please contact us at <a href="mailto:cdmneptuneoe@proton.me?subject=MINORS%2018%20INFORMATION%20N&body=I%20have%20information%20with%20relation%20at%20minors%20of%2018%20years.%20:)">cdmneptuneoe@proton.me </a>.

	 <p class="main">
		<b>In short:</b> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the 
European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you

	 <p class="main">
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications 
include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your 
privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored 
and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and 
implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to 
DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your 
choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we 
must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of 
this Privacy Notice.<br>
<br>
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT 
signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard 
for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
